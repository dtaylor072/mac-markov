Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my he, he, he, tea

[Verse 1]
You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like ""I before E, except after C""
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[Chorus]
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi

[Verse 2]
Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an ""A"" (how to get an ""A"")
Spell ""me"" and ""you"" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

[Chorus]
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

[Interlude]
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

[Bridge]
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby

Lemme teach how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

All I Want for Christmas Is You,,"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
And I, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of childrens'
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me
The one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me quickly?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby"
Almost Is Never Enough,Yours Truly,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Verse 2: Nathan Sykes]
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

[Bridge: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Huh-huh, baby
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Nathan Sykes]
Almost, almost is never enough (is never enough, baby)
So close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enough

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Huh-huh, baby (almost)
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey"
Ariana Grande,,"{Peek}
Maybe one day you'll feel happy
Aside from all these sad things
I know I don't deserve it
But I can't stop dreamin'

Maybe one day you'll feel happy
Aside from all these sad things
I know I don't deserve it
But I can't stop dreamin'

You deserve the best (Yeah, the best)
So on you go without him (without him)
Leave everything behind
We'll take care, we'll take care
Of everything for you"

Baby Loves (Intro),,"Baby loves, I'm tryna talk to you
There’s a boy
And I don't quite know
What to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me, shows me, he’s the one
For sure the one
I think I'd rather wait for him forever
Instead of having him just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do"

Learning you were wrong, woah

Beauty and the Beast

Beauty and the Beast
Woah
A-a-ay

Be My Baby,My Everything,"[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my baby
Be my, be my
Be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Verse 1]
If you know how to treat me
You know how to touch me
Baby, then you’ll get the chance, the chance to love me
It’s obvious I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want, that you want babe
Just show me everything I need to see
I’ll give you anything, boy

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my baby
Be my, be my
Be my baby, and drive me crazy

[Verse 2]
I’ll give you all of my trust if you don’t mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only girl you see
So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh, baby boy, I promise that I’ll be on you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, on you
Night to the mo-o-o-o-o-orning

[Chorus]
If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby

Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me boy and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my

Best Mistake,My Everything,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Outro: Ariana Grande & Big Sean]
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You, you, you, you
(Best mistake you ever had)
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you"

Better Left Unsaid,Yours Truly,"[Verse 1]
I told you once, ""Get out my life
I don't need ya
I'll be alright.""
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
My broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swore that I would never say
""I miss you more every day""
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna say things like ""shut up and kiss me""
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me just kiss me, oh
I'll never say ""please""
Don't play me, just kiss me

[Verse 2]
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

​better off,Sweetener,"[Verse 1]
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love'll have you fall to your knees
I tell them this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss them all, no offense, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand

On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya"

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus 1]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Chorus 2]
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Refrain]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

[Breakdown]
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down"

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout nothing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!

Feminism (Quotes),,"""When will people stop being offended by women showing skin / expressing sexuality? Men take their shirts off / express their sexuality onstage, in videos, on Instagram, anywhere they want to… All. The. Time. The double standard is so boring and exhausting. With all due respect, i think it's time you get your head out of your ass. [sic] Women can love their bodies too!!""
– responding to a commenter who said she was ""like a whore"" in her ""Dangerous Woman"" video, on Facebook

""The incredible double standard that we [women] face on a daily basis, in the industry and just in the world, it's shocking. I would be so amused, and pardon me if this comes across as sexist, but I don't think a male artist would be in this position right now. Sorry. If i'm speaking about something that I'm passionate about, I'm willing to take the brunt for fighting in what I believe in and my fellow women are definitely something that I will always be one of the first to speak up about.""

""Is this what you think girls have trouble choosing between? … Is this men assuming that that's what girls would have to choose between? … You need a little brushing up on equality over here.""

""I have a long list of things I'd like to change … I think, judgement in general. Intolerance, meanness, double standards, misogyny, racism, sexism. You know, all that shit. There's lots we've got to get started on. That's what we need to focus on. We've got work to do.""
– responding to the question ""If you could use makeup or your phone one last time, what would you pick?"" on California's Power 106 FM

""I'm tired of needing to be linked to a guy, I'm not Big Sean's ex, I'm not Niall's new possible girl. I'm Ariana Grande.""
– to The Sun

""What I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I … do not. Belong. To Anyone. But myself. And neither do you … I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating/ married/ attached to, having sex with (or not)/ seen with … but by their value as an individual. ""

""[People] are so ignorant sometimes. Stop trying to make people feel badly about their bodies. It's okay to be different ... to be curvy or to be thin. When did it become socially acceptable to comment on what you think is 'wrong' with other people's bodies? We were having fun! Dancing on stage. 'What's she shaking tho???' I'm shaking my pretty, cute, petite ass next to Nicki's pretty big booty. Both are f---ing awesome. How about we respect people's body boundaries and encourage each other to feel like a babe no matter how they are? That [would] be nice. So tired of watching everyone try to tear each other down.""
– on Instagram

""Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled 'After Black Power, Women's Liberation' and 46 years later … we're still not quite there yet! If a woman has lots of sex (or any sex for that matter) … she's a 'slut.' If a man has sex … HE'S. A. STUD. A BOSSSSSS. A KING. If a woman even talks about sex openly … she is shamed! But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used 'bitches'/‘hoes' … how lovely) he's had … he is regaled. If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!! If a man is seen with a woman his status is elevated/celebrated.""

Focus,Dangerous Woman,"[Verse 1]
I know what I came to do
And that ain't gonna change
So go ahead and talk your talk
'Cause I won't take the bait
I'm over here doin' what I like
I'm over here workin' day and night
And if my real ain't real enough
I'm sorry for you, bae

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holdin' us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away, woo

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Ariana Grande)]
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)

[Verse 2]
I can tell you're curious
It's written on your lips
Ain't no need to hold it back
Go 'head and talk your shit
I know you're hopin' that I'll react
I know you're hopin' I'm lookin' back
But if my real ain't real enough
Then I don't know what is

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Ariana Grande)]
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)

[Breakdown]
One, two, three, c'mon girls
You're gonna like it
Come on, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's find a light inside our universe now
Where ain't nobody keep on holding us down
Just come and get it, let them say what they say
'Cause I'm about to put them all away

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Ariana Grande)]
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me, f-f-focus on me
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)
Focus on me (focus), f-f-focus on me (focus on me)"
Focus (Meaning),,"""The first line of 'Focus' is: 'I know what I came to do and that ain't gonna change.' What I came here to do in this world is not only to entertain but to love, to share, to listen, to improve, to learn, to share music, to share experience, to share feelings, to make people feel happy and empowered,"" she explained.

""To make people feel like they're not alone. Without using my voice to do those things I would feel empty,"" she continued. ""When I say 'focus on me' I'm not asking to be the center of attention. I'm not asking you to focus on my face or my clothes or my body or my singing voice. By 'focus on me,' I literally mean focus on me. Focus on what I'm all about and what I believe in.

""The more we focus on each other as people and not on what we look like, what we're wearing, our gender, our hairstyle, our sexuality, the color of our skin. But focus on each other on a soul level. The more we realize how much we have in common, the more we listen to each other, the more one we become.""

The title of Ari's track might seem like an effort to get people to focus on the right things about her, too, since she's had such a tumultuous year (ahem, remember the donut incident?), but she insists this is about all of us.

""You judge because you don't focus on me, you don't focus on each other,"" she explained. ""You judge because you focus on appearance, on clothes. You focus on what you want from me, what you want from people. How you want them to wear their hair. You judge me, you wanna see me dressed a certain way, how you wanna see their make-up, their eyebrows. You focus on what you think people should be like for you. But when you stop and you actually focus on someone, you'll see the light in them. When you focus on me, you see the light in me. When we focus on each other, we see the light in each other. And even if you don't, this is who we are. What are we making fun of? What's there to make fun of? We should apologize for that."""

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now"
Higher,,"[Intro]
Higher... uh huh

[Verse 1]
Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak

Only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I fell this spark ignite

You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doing- living, letting go (go, go)
Riding, having good times and no one has to know

He's bringing out the freak in me

It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I fell this spark ignite

Honeymoon Avenue,Yours Truly,"[Intro: Leon Thomas III]
It's The Rascals!

[Verse 1]
I looked in my rear view mirror
And it seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead us
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that can be the death of us, the death of us

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Verse 2]
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we’ve found it
Well, that’s when we start turning around
You're saying, ""Baby, don't worry.""
But we're still going the wrong way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

[Bridge]
They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talking about us
Sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gonna be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home

[Chorus]
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coasting like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?

Baby, this a microphone checkup
What you getting into when you get up?
When I wake up early, I'm gonna text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby, I could do it better
And it really ain't the plan
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could pull me in, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky
Looking up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night, everything's alright
When you lay down, I'mma hit the lights
(If you say so)
And what's a life if you don't got me?
Give you what you want, what you need

All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me

I don't ever ask you
Where you've been
'Cause I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell
You were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart

Just a little bit is all I'm asking for"
Just For Now,,"[Intro]
Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now

[Verse 1]
How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

[Chorus]
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

[Interlude]
Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

[Verse 2]
I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

[Chorus]
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
(If just for a little while)
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
(I'm secretly on your side)

Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Love The Way You Lie,,"On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right

Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie"

Is falling in love wasn’t part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I’ll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again

Moonlight,Dangerous Woman,"[Verse 1]
The sun is setting
And you're right here by my side
And the movie's playing
But we won't be watching tonight
Every look, every touch
Makes me wanna give you my heart
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are 'cause

[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight

[Verse 2]
I kiss his fingertips
As I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis
With some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (puts his lips) on my neck (on my neck)
Makes me want to give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby
And I just can't stop 'cause

[Chorus]
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight
Baby, I be fallin'
You are my moonlight
Moonlight

[Verse 3]
He's so bossy
He makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When he’s holding me tight
And he calls me ""Moonlight"" too"
My Everything,My Everything,"[Verse 1]
I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

[Chorus]
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

[Verse 2]
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know sorry ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

[Chorus]
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything"

Passionate but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I’m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far?
This far

I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed"

Open Letter Critiquing Sexism,,"Being ""empowered""...... is not the same as being a ""bitch""...
HAVING SOMETHING TO SAY...... is not the same as HAVING A BAD ATTITUDE....

what I meant when I said what I said about not being Sean's ex is that I am tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I... do not. belong. to anyone. but myself. and neither do you.
I have clearly not been having the boy questions in my interviews lately because I have come to the realization that I have SO. MUCH. MORE. to talk about. I'm currently making the best music I've ever made in my life, having the best time of my life on tour with some of the greatest people I've ever known, working my ass off every single day, performing / creating for my babes and getting the chance to meet and hug my babes all over the world every day.

I come from a long bloodline of female activists. my aunt Judy was the first Italian american female president of the national press club in Washington DC. I think she would have been proud of me for speaking up about something that has been bothering me personally for so long.
Gloria Steinem published an article in 1969 titled ""After Black Power, Women's Liberation"".... and 46 years later... we're still not quite there yet!
If a women has a lot of sex (or any sex for that matter).... she's a ""slut"".
If a man has sex..... HE'S. A. STUD. a BOSSSSSS. a KING.
If a woman even TALKS about sex openly.... she is shamed!
But if a man talks or RAPS freely about all the women (or more commonly used ""bitches""/""hoes""... how lovely) he's had... he is regaled.
If a woman is seen with a friend with a penis, there is an immediate assumption of romance or sex and she is labeled!!
If a man is seen with a woman... his status is elevated / celebrated. ""AWW SHIIIT HE SMASHED!!!1!!1!"".

I know y'all already know this but the double standard and misogyny are still ever present.
I can't wait to live in a world where people are not valued by who they're dating / married to / attached to, having sex with (or not) / seen with.... but by their value as an individual.

I want the people reading this to know that they are MORE THAN enough on their own.
I want the media to please help me with this!!!!!!!!! Please support each other.
I'm saying this after literally 8 years of feeling like I constantly had to have a boy by my side. After being on my own now for a few months I am realizing that that's just not the case.... I have never felt more present, grounded, and satisfied. I've never laughed harder or had more fun or enjoyed my life more.

One more thought.... my honeymoon diaries are my way of sharing absolutely as much as I can with my fans. that is something I have done since day one and never plan on changing. it is a safe environment for me to be myself and share funny, special, personal things with my fans and to laugh about silly things I've done / things I'm going through. I don't plan on monitoring or changing that because there are more eyes on me now than there were before. I love y'all with all my heart.... you've accepted and celebrated me not only as an artist but as a person since day one and and nothing will change that or change me.

""any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke.. She will need her sisterhood."" - Gloria Steinem"
Open Letter to Fans,,"So the news is out about Sam & Cat. I felt it wasn’t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are…. I think that’s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good

I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character (and she is) but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book…… she wouldn’t judge anybody by their appearance…. she believed the best in people…. she wasn’t afraid of anything or anybody…. she never let people’s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted… she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real (which is something I personally do all the time but I wish I could shake that and celebrate every little thing like she does)

One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that’s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way

So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some ‘dumb’ kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us

Hopefully we’ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I’d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They’d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)

Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn’t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can’t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood

Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted

Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started… you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We’ve been through so much and you are still here… and we’ve got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you forever"

We're gonna make this bubble
We'll carbonate some trouble

She cried"
​R.E.M,Sweetener,"[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep (sleep)
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe (If you can believe)
You're such a dream to me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
""Excuse me, um, I love you""
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like:
""I love you—who starts a conversation like that?""
Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? (Is this real?)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande & Pharrell Williams]
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, ""What happened? Why you?""
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)
The Good Housekeeping Seal
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me"

Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?

Never has it been so easy to be in love

[Verse 3: Big Sean + Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change

You call for me, I’m right there (right there)

And I'm trying to play it cool

Suitcase,,"I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same

Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes

Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone

So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone

Them Changes (Live at BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge),,"[Verse 1]
So, nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
So where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
So deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

[Verse 2]
So somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
So where were you when I needed you the most?
Why in the hell would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
So now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest

The Wizard And I,A Very Wicked Halloween ,"When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And when I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since- since birth!

And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded?
No!

He'll say to me, ""I see who you truly are -
A girl on whom I can rely!""
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I

Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange!

No father is not proud of you
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard, you're acclaimed

And this gift or this curse I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand in hand
The Wizard and I..

And one day, he'll say to me
""Elphaba, a girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be all right by you
If I de-greenify you?""

And though of course, that's not important to me
""All right, why not?"" I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be The Wizard and I
Yes, what a pair we'll be The Wizard and-

Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy, I know
It sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me!

And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'll be so happy, I could melt!

And so it will be
For the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else till I die

Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's favorite team
The Wizard and I"

You Don't Know Me,My Everything,"[Verse 1]
Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
But they don't understand
They don't understand, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (you don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (you don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

[Verse 2]
The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (you don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (you don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

[Bridge]
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

[Breakdown]
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

[Chorus]
I don't need to live by your rules (you don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (you don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules (you don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (you don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing my dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

[Outro]
My love"
You'll Never Know,Yours Truly,"[Verse 1]
Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it’s overkill
Don’t get mad at me 'cause you’ve been replaced
Know your place

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Verse 2]
Now it’s probably hard for you to hear
But there’s nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, but you don’t understand
Is a girl like me don’t have no time to waste around

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it’d be different
If you spoke, I would’ve listened
But now, I’m with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, but...

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve told me, told me
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Bridge]
It’s not my fault
You’re a little bit too late
You’re the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you’ll never get back, get back

[Chorus]
You will never know what we could have been
If you would’ve shown your way back then
Boy, you gotta (yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (yup, yup)
'Cause you didn’t know, so
Now you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve told me, told me
You’ll never know
Boy, you should’ve let me know
You’ll never know
Boy, you could’ve been there for me
But now you’ll never know, you’ll never know

[Outro]
Boy, you’ll never know, you’ll never know
You’ll never know, you’ll never know"

Ariana, Iyaz

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande & (Iyaz)]
Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
(Come on, and ring, ring, ring, yeah)
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid (yeah)
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee

As long as I'm your one and only destination

See, yeah, back in the day, I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed (same old)
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave (oh)
I don't need to bring in all the attention (hey, yeah)
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

"Zero to Hero (From ""Hercules"")",We Love Disney ,"[Intro]
Hercules
Hercules

[Verse 1]
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

[Verse 2]
When he smiled, the girls went wild with (""oohs"" and ""aahs"")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every ""vahse""
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

[Verse 3]
Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

[Verse 4]
Who put the glad in gladiator?
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great the-a-tee?
(Hercules!)
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

[Verse 5]
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
(Hercules, Hercules)
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes, indeed"
