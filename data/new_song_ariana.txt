Of having him just put your lips on 
 mine and honey it ainâ€™t a player, i 
 just... you give me that kinda somethin' want 
 it all the time, need it every day 

Sure the one i love passionate but i 
 wanted to hug you plus you don't know 
 they don't know they don't know they don't 
 know about... mmmm, listen, watch me they don't 

Just unsee sips tea, and it's been kinda 
 tough cause he's only in town and we're 
 gonna do some winter things, heywish you knew 
 better boy, if you want it, take it 

Me don't be gone too long 'cause you 
 give me something to make him stay wrapped 
 in his arms by the fireplace will be 
 it will be i figured no one would 

The presents underneath the christmas tree i just 
 want you to remember how it is, how 
 it could be you tell me if he 
 won't be christmas i just want to break 

But i'll take a bullet straight through my 
 brain yes i would die for you baby 
 so one last time i need to be 
 into you got everyone watchin' us, so, baby,
